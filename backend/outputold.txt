Q1)
a) Population mean = 72 bpm
   Sample mean = 69 bpm.

b) H₀: The new relaxation app does not reduce the average resting rate of regular users.
   H₁: The new relaxation app reduces the average resting rate of regular users.

c) (x̄ - μ) / (σ/√n) => (69-72) / (8/√64) => -3/8 = standard error
   => The no.of errors from the baseline to the mean.

d) Z-score = (x̄ - μ) / se => -3 / (3/8) => 24/3 => -8

e)
[IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
The image shows a hand-drawn normal distribution curve.
- The curve is centered around the population mean (72 bpm).
- A vertical line is drawn at 69 bpm, indicating the sample mean.
- The area to the left of 69 bpm is shaded, representing the probability of observing a sample mean less than or equal to 69 bpm.

TEXT IN IMAGE:
- 69
- 72

IMAGE TYPE: illustration
IMAGE CONTEXT: This visual relates to the Z-score and hypothesis testing for Question 1, part e)]

Q2)
a) P(B|A).P(A) = 20%

b) P(A|B)
   If the message is not spam, the filter still marks it as "spam" with probability 0.05.

c) P(B) = P(B|A).P(A) + P(B|¬A).P(¬A)
   = 0.95 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8
   = 0.23

d) Posterior Probability is higher.
