      "asset_content": "Based on the provided course settings, we are to design a curriculum for an \"Intro to Python\" course, primarily targeting first-year students majoring in \"AI & Decentralised Technologies\". The pedagogical approach emphasizes projects, which implies that students will learn best through hands-on experiences, applying the concepts in practical applications relevant to AI and Blockchain technologies.\n\n### Approach for Course Design\n\n1. **Foundation of Python Programming**: Given that this is an introductory course for Year 1 students, the curriculum should begin with fundamental programming concepts using Python. This includes syntax, data types, and basic operations to ensure everyone starts with a solid grounding.\n\n2. **Application to AI and Decentralised Technologies**: Since the study area is \"AI & Decentralised Technologies,\" the course should quickly transition into relevant applications of Python in these fields. The course should emphasize practical programming skills and applications that prepare students for further studies in AI and decentralized systems.\n\n3. **Project-Based Learning**: Given the pedagogical component emphasizes projects, the course should focus on creating opportunities for students to work on projects that integrate Python programming with AI and decentralized technology principles. This could involve mini-projects culminating in a final project where students demonstrate their accumulated knowledge and skills.\n\n### Proposed Topics\n\n1. **Introduction to Python Programming**\n   - Python Syntax and Semantics\n   - Variables and Data Types\n   - Control Structures: Conditionals and Loops\n\n2. **Data Structures and Algorithms with Python**\n   - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries\n   - Functions and Modular Programming\n   - Basic Algorithms and Problem-solving\n\n3. **Python Application in AI**\n   - Introduction to Libraries like NumPy and Pandas\n   - Basic Data Manipulation\n   - Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts\n\n4. **Python Application in Decentralised Technologies**\n   - Understanding Blockchain Basics\n   - Python Libraries for Blockchain (e.g., Web3.py)\n   - Smart Contract Basics\n\n5. **Project Development**\n   - Project Planning and Design\n   - Implementing a Python-Based AI or Decentralised Technology Project\n   - Presentation and Documentation of Project",
