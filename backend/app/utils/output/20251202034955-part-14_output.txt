QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 95 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - Text is clear and legible, with minimal uncertainty.
- Visual Elements: 24/25 - The sketch is clear and described accurately.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables in this question.
- Handwriting Legibility: 13/15 - Handwriting is mostly clear, with some minor ambiguity in symbols.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- Minor ambiguity in the symbols used for hypotheses.

QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 90 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 36/40 - Text is clear, but there are some unclear symbols in the probability expressions.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No visual elements in this question.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables in this question.
- Handwriting Legibility: 9/15 - Some symbols and subscripts are less clear.

TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 92.5 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 37/40 - Overall text is clear, with some minor ambiguities in symbols.
- Visual Elements: 24.5/25 - Visual elements are clear and well-described.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Handwriting is generally clear but some symbols and subscripts are ambiguous.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Ambiguity in mathematical symbols and subscripts.
- Ensuring accurate interpretation of handwritten mathematical expressions.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for text and visual elements.
- Some manual review may be needed for mathematical expressions and symbols.
