8.
a) Population Mean = simple random samples of 64.
Sample Mean = 64 regular Users.

b) Null hypothesis: A simple random sample is ≤ 64
Alternative hypothesis: A simple random sample is > 64.

c) Standard Error is 64 which is the total sample Mean.

9.
a) P(A) = 0.8
P(B) = 0.2
P(A^c) = 0.9
P(A^C) = 0.1

b) Posterior Probability = P(B|A) P(A)

c) P(A|B) = (P(B|A) P(A)) / (P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^C) P(A^C))

### PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES

**QUESTION 8 CONFIDENCE: 90 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 8:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - Clear handwriting, minor ambiguity in phrasing for hypothesis statements.
- Visual Elements: 22/25 - Diagram is a rough sketch, labels are clear but layout is informal.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 10/15 - Some words are slightly unclear but generally legible.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 8:
- The phrasing in part (b) is slightly ambiguous regarding the direction of the alternative hypothesis.
- The sketch in part (c) lacks detail but is interpretable.

**QUESTION 9 CONFIDENCE: 95 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 9:
- Text Accuracy: 39/40 - Very clear handwriting, all probabilities and formulas are accurately transcribed.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No visual elements to describe.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Minor inconsistency in notation (A^C vs A^c) but overall clear.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 9:
- Inconsistent notation for the complement of A (A^C vs A^c).
- No significant issues otherwise.

### TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 92.5 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 38.5/40 - High accuracy in text extraction, minor ambiguities in phrasing.
- Visual Elements: 23.5/25 - Sketch in Question 8 is basic but interpretable.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 10.5/15 - Some inconsistencies and minor ambiguities in notation.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Inconsistent notation for the complement of set A in Question 9.
- Informal sketch in Question 8 lacks detail but is understandable.
- Minor phrasing ambiguities in hypothesis statements.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for the text portions, with only minor uncertainties.
- The sketch in Question 8 should be reviewed for precise interpretation.
- Overall, the extraction is suitable for automated processing with minimal manual review.
