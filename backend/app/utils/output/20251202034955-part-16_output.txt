Question 1:
----------------------------------------
a)
population mean : 72 bpm
Sample mean : 69 bpm

b)
H₀ : Relaxation app reduces the average resting was greater/ equal to bpm sale than
H₁ : Relaxation app was loss of bpm (Normal people Crate than Normal people)

c) d = 72 - 69 = 3

Mean (Standard) = σ / √n = 10 / √64 = 1.25

d) z = d / se = 3 / 1.25

e)
[IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
TEXT IN IMAGE: 69 72 bpm
IMAGE TYPE: line_graph
IMAGE CONTEXT: Normal distribution curve showing the population mean at 72 bpm and sample mean at 69 bpm with shaded area on the left side under the curve.

QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 92 / 100

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - Text is mostly clear with minor ambiguity in part (b) regarding phrasing.
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - The image is well-described, though the exact shading extent is inferred.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present in this question.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some words in part (b) are slightly unclear, particularly "sale than" and "Crate."

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- Part (b) contains unclear phrasing and possible spelling errors ("greater/ equal to bpm sale than," "Crate").
- The exact meaning of "loss of bpm" is ambiguous.
- The diagram's shading is not explicitly described in the student's work but inferred from context.

TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 92 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - High accuracy with minor ambiguities in phrasing.
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - Effective description of the diagram, though shading details are inferred.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables were present in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some parts of the handwriting, particularly in hypothesis statements, are unclear.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Ambiguity in phrasing for hypothesis statements in part (b).
- Interpretation of the diagram's shading without explicit student annotation.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for numerical and formulaic content.
- Hypothesis statements may require manual review for precise interpretation.
- Diagram description is based on standard statistical conventions.
