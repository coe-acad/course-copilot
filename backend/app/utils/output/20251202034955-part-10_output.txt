Question 1:
----------------------------------------
Q1
   a. New relaxation app reduces the average is the population mean. 64 regular users is the sample mean.
   b. Null Hypothesis is the new relaxation app reduces are equal to the average resting heart rate its regular users
   alternative hypothesis is the new relaxation app is greater than the average resting heart rate its regular users.
   c. standard error means to know the average of the sample and to the know the differences

   d. Z-score = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n) = (64, 3-0) / √64
     = 3 / 8
     = 0.375

   TEXT IN IMAGE:
   - A hand-drawn bell curve with a vertical dashed line at 64, indicating the mean.
   - The right tail of the curve is shaded, representing the p-value.

   IMAGE CONTEXT: This image relates to the hypothesis testing in question 1.]

   b. H₀ ≤ 64
      H₁ > 64

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
Q2
   a. Prior probability is P(A)
      The value of the prior probability is P(A) = 0.9
   b. Posterior probability is P(A|B), the probability of spam given marked as spam.
   c. P(A) = 0.9
      P(A∩B) = 20%
      P(A|B) = 0.05

      This is the formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

      To find P(B) the formula is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

   d. I think so it will be lower than the prior because it is based on data that we can say in our data
      the prior is 0.9 and the posterior is 20%, i.e. 0.2
