Question 1:
----------------------------------------
a. New relaxation app reduces the average is the population mean. 6u regular users is the sample mean.

b. Null Hypothesis is the new relaxation app reduces are equal to the average resting heart rate its regular users alternative hypothesis is the new relaxation app is greater than the average resting heart rate its regular users.

c. standard error means to know the average of the sample and to know the differences

d. Z-score = (d̅ - o) / n = 64. 3 - o / √64 = 3 / 8 = -0.375

b. H₀ = 64
H₁ = 764

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
a. prior probability is P(A)
The value of the prior probability is P(A) = 0.4

b. posterior probability is P(A|B), the probability of spam given marked as spam.

c. P(A) = 0.4
   P(A|B) = 20%
   P(A|B) = 0.08

This is the formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) · P(A) / [P(B|A) · P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ) · P(Aᶜ)]

To find P(B) the formula is P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ) P(Aᶜ)

d. I think so it will be lower than the prior because the p̂ is based on data that we can say in our data the prior is 0.4 and the posterior is 20% ie 0.2

### PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES

**QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 88 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 36/40 - Some minor interpretation issues with handwriting, particularly in parts b and c.
- Visual Elements: 22/25 - The diagram is well-described, but the exact z-score calculation had minor ambiguity.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 10/15 - Some words were unclear, particularly in hypothesis statements.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- The handwriting for "6u" in part a and "d̅" in part d was slightly unclear.
- The hypothesis statements in part b had some ambiguous phrasing.
- The diagram's exact labels were not entirely clear but the overall structure was captured.

---

**QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 90 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 37/40 - Mostly clear, but some probability values were slightly ambiguous.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No images or diagrams present.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 13/15 - Some characters in formulas were unclear, particularly "P(A|B)".

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- The probability values in part c were slightly unclear (e.g., "20%" vs "0.2").
- The formula in part c had some ambiguous notation.
- The phrasing in part d was slightly unclear but interpretable.

---

### TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 89 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 36.5/40 - Generally high accuracy, with minor issues in ambiguous handwriting.
- Visual Elements: 23.5/25 - The diagram was well-described, but some minor details were unclear.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables were present in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11.5/15 - Some sections had unclear handwriting, particularly in formulas and hypothesis statements.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Ambiguous notation in mathematical expressions, particularly in z-score and probability formulas.
- Some words and phrases were unclear due to handwriting legibility.
- The exact values in probability statements required careful interpretation.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for the overall content and structure.
- Minor uncertainties in specific values and notation should be reviewed if precise accuracy is critical.
- The diagram description is comprehensive and accurately reflects the visual content.
