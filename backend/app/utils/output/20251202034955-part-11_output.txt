================================================================================

Question 1:
----------------------------------------
a) Population mean is 72 bpm and the Sample mean is 64. 64 regular users of the app.
   b) Null Hypothesis (H₀): New relaxation app does not reduce the average resting heart rate of its regular users.
   Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): New relaxation app reduces the average resting heart rate of its regular users.
   c) Standard error is 10/√64.
     Standard error is the standard deviation/mean.

   d)
   \[
   Z = \frac{X - \mu}{SE} = \frac{69 - 72}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{64}}} = \frac{-3}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{64}}}
   \]

================================================================================

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
a) Prior probability is 0.2 or 20%, and P(A) is the prior probability.
   b) Posterior probability is P(A|B). Posterior probability is the final updated evidence of the probability or it is the probability of spam given marked as spam.
   c)
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B|A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)
   P(A) = 0.2, P(A^c) = 0.8
   P(B|A) = 0.9, P(B|A^c) = 0.05

   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.9}{P(B)} = \frac{0.18}{0.22} = 0.818
   \]
   P(B) = 0.9 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8 = 0.22

   d) Yes, the posterior probability will be higher than the prior. The posterior will be higher than prior. Because prior is tight while we update the probability by the evidence.

2. a) Prior probability is 0.2 or 20%, and P(A) is the prior probability.
   b) Posterior probability is P(A|B). Posterior probability is the final updated evidence of the probability or it is the probability of spam given marked as spam.
   c)
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B|A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)
   P(A) = 0.2, P(A^c) = 0.8
   P(B|A) = 0.9, P(B|A^c) = 0.05

   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.9}{P(B)} = \frac{0.18}{0.22} = 0.818
   \]
   P(B) = 0.9 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8 = 0.22

   d) Yes, the posterior probability will be higher than the prior. The posterior will be higher than prior. Because prior is tight while we update the probability by the evidence.
