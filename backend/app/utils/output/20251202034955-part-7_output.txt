Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) The Population mean is 72 bpm & Sample Mean is 69 bpm

(b) null hypothesis H₀: μ ≥ 72 bpm
alternative hypothesis H₁: μ < 72 bpm

(c) Standard error = (72 - 69)/2
[UNCERTAIN: calculation appears incomplete or unclear]

Standard Error means the distance bw baseline and Sample mean

================================================================================

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(a) P(B) = 0.20 x ~ 0.2 | Probability of Prior = P(B|S) x P(S) =
P(B) = 0.9

= 0.9 x 0.2 = 0.18

(b) P(S/F) ≈ P(F/S) x P(S)
        P(F/S) x P(S) + P(F/~S) x P(~S)

P(F/S) = 0.9
P(~S) = 0.2
P(F/~S) = 0.05
P(S) = 100 - 20% = 80 = 0.8
P(~S) = 0.8

P(S/F) ≈ 0.9 x 0.2
        0.9 x 0.2 + 0.05 x 0.8

≈ 0.18
  0.18 + 0.04

≈ 0.8

(b) Posterior Probability in the experiment above is P(S/F)

QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 88 / 100
- Text Accuracy: 36/40 - Most text is clear, but one calculation in part (c) is uncertain and appears incomplete.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No visual elements present.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 12/15 - Some parts are slightly unclear, particularly the calculation in (c).

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- The standard error calculation in part (c) is unclear and may be incomplete.
- Some minor ambiguity in handwriting for mathematical symbols.

---

QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 85 / 100
- Text Accuracy: 34/40 - Some expressions are slightly unclear, particularly the use of "~" and "=" signs.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No visual elements present.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some probability expressions are cramped and slightly difficult to read.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- The notation "~" for complement is occasionally unclear.
- The alignment of fractions and equations is slightly ambiguous.
- Some probability values are written in a condensed manner.

TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 86.5 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 35/40 - Most text is clear, but some calculations and probability expressions are ambiguous.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No visual elements were present in the extracted content.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables were present in the extracted content.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11.5/15 - Handwriting is generally legible but has some unclear or cramped sections.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Some mathematical expressions and calculations are incomplete or unclear.
- Probability notation and alignment of equations are occasionally ambiguous.
- The use of shorthand and symbols in probability expressions can be difficult to interpret.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for clear, well-written sections.
- Caution is advised for interpreting uncertain or incomplete calculations.
- The student's use of notation should be reviewed for consistency.
