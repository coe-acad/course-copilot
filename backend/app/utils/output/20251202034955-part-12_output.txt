Question 1:
----------------------------------------
H₀: The new relaxation app does not reduce the average resting heart rate

H₁: The new relaxation app reduces the average resting heart rate

(c) Standard error = σ / √n

σ = 10 bpm    n = 64

Standard error = σ / √n

Standard error = 10 / √64

Standard error = 10 / 8

Standard error = 1.2 (Approx)

================================================================================

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(d) Z-Score, Z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)

σ / √n = 5 / 4

X̄ = 69 bpm    μ = 72 bpm

Z = (72 - 69) / (5 / 4)

Z = 3 / (5 / 4)

Z = 12 / 5 ≈ 2.4

================================================================================

Question 3:
----------------------------------------
[IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with a vertical dashed line near the center labeled 72, and another vertical dashed line to the left labeled 69. The area to the left of 69 is shaded and labeled "P-value".

TEXT IN IMAGE:
- 69
- 72
- P-value

IMAGE TYPE: line_graph

IMAGE CONTEXT: This graph relates to the z-score calculation for the resting heart rate hypothesis test.]

================================================================================

Question 4:
----------------------------------------
(a) Population mean = 72 bpm
Sample mean = 69 bpm

================================================================================

Question 5:
----------------------------------------
P(A|B) = [P(A) P(B|A)] / [P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ) P(Aᶜ)]

P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ) P(Aᶜ)

Let A be the spam and Aᶜ be the non-spam message and B is the filter

(c) P(A) is the prior in the above equation.

P(A) = 20 / 100 = 1 / 5

P(A) = 1 / 5

(d) P(A|B) is the posterior probability in the above equation. Posterior is being the product prior and evidence factor.

Evidence factor = P(B|A) / P(B) = P(B|A) / [P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ) P(Aᶜ)]

================================================================================

Question 6:
----------------------------------------
(e) Since P(A|B) is final Probability from the expression given in question then P(A|Bᶜ) will be it's compliment so that when P(A|B) and P(A|Bᶜ) adds up it gives 1 as total Probability.

P(A) = 1 / 5

P(Aᶜ) = 1 - 1 / 5 = 4 / 5

P(B|A) = 0.9

P(B|Aᶜ) = 0.05

================================================================================

Question 7:
----------------------------------------
(a) The posterior probability will be higher depending upon evidence factor. Based on that

(b) The posterior probability will be higher than Prior. Reason is that (Plenty) Prior multiplies with Evidence factor.

TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 94 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - High accuracy overall, minor issues with mathematical notation spacing and occasional unclear phrasing.
- Visual Elements: 24.5/25 - One image described with high accuracy, minor uncertainty in shading.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 13.5/15 - Generally clear handwriting with occasional crowding and minor ambiguities.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Interpreting partially obscured or crowded mathematical notation.
- Describing the image with precise detail based on limited visibility.
- Distinguishing between similar-looking words or intended corrections (e.g., "compliment" vs "complement").
- Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment in mathematical expressions.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for automated processing, with only minor uncertainties in phrasing and image description.
- Mathematical content is accurately captured with only negligible formatting ambiguities.
- Per-question confidence scores reflect the high overall quality of the extraction.
