1. b) Ho: The new relaxation app does not reduce the average resting heart rate
   H₁: The new relaxation app reduces the average resting heart rate

c) Standard error = σ / √n
   σ = 10 bpm, n = 64
   Standard error = 10 / √64
   Standard error = 10 / 8
   Standard error = 1.2 (Approx)

---
d) Z-Score, Z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)
   σ / √n = 5 / 4
   x̄ = 72 bpm, μ = 69 bpm
   Z = (72 - 69) / (5 / 4)
   Z = 3 / (5 / 4)
   Z = 12 / 5 = 2.4

[IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
- The image shows a normal distribution curve with a shaded area on the right side.
- The center of the distribution is marked at 69.
- The shaded area starts from 72 and extends to the right.
- The shaded area is labeled as P-Value.

IMAGE TYPE: illustration
IMAGE CONTEXT: This image relates to the Z-Score and P-Value for the question on heart rate.]

a) Population mean = 72 bpm
   Sample mean = 69 bpm

2.
a) P(A|B) = [P(B|A) P(A)] / [P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)]
   P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)
   Let A be the spam message and A^c be the non-spam message and B is the filter.

---
b) P(A) is the prior in the above equation.
   P(A) = 20 / 100 = 1 / 5
   P(A) = 1 / 5

---
c) Since P(A|B) is final Probability from the expression given in question then P(A|B^c) will be its complement.
   So that when P(A|B) and P(A|B^c) adds up it gives 1 as total Probability.

   P(A) = 1 / 5
   P(A^c) = 1 - 1 / 5 = 4 / 5
   P(B|A) = 0.9
   P(B|A^c) = 0.05

---
d) The posterior Probability will be higher depending upon evidence factor. Based on that

   The posterior Probability will be higher than Prior. Reason is that (Prior) multiplies with evidence factor.
