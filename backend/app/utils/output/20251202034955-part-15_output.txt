1. (a) population mean = 64
   sample mean = 69

---
(b) null = new app does not reduce resting heart rates
Alternative : new app reduces resting heart rates

   H₀: A_new > A_old
   H₁: A_new < A_old

---
(c) SE = σ / √n = 10 / √64 = 10 / 8 = 5 / 4

   it shows how far the sample mean is from the baseline

---
(d) Z = (69 - 72) / (10/8) = (3 × 8) / 10 = 24 / 10 = 2.4

   Z = (Sₘ - μ) / SE

(e)
[IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
- The image is a hand-drawn normal distribution curve.
- The curve is centered around a mean value, with a vertical line drawn at 69 and 72.
- The area under the curve to the left of 69 is shaded, indicating the probability of the sample mean being less than 69.

TEXT IN IMAGE:
- 69
- 72

IMAGE TYPE: illustration
IMAGE CONTEXT: This visual relates to question 1(e) and shows the distribution of sample means.]

2. P(S) = 20% = 0.2
   P(M|S) = 0.9
   P(M|¬S) = 0.05

   p(S|M) = P(S) × P(M|S) / P(M)

---
(a) prior probability → P(S)
   P(S) = 0.2

---
(b) posterior probability ⇒ P(S|M)
   it is the probability that we are searching for which in this case is probability of spam given the message is spam.

---
(c) p(S|M) = 0.2 × 0.9 / (0.9 × 0.2) + (0.05 × 0.8)

   P(M) = total probability
   P(M) = P(M|S) × P(S) + P(M|¬S) × P(¬S)
   = 0.9 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8

---
(d) lower, since it is a conditional probability, we have a new world
   Since world is smaller, posterior probability will also be lower
