Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) population mean : 64
    sample mean : 69

(b) null = new app does not reduce resting heart rates
    Alternative : new app reduces resting heart rates

    H₀ : A_new > A_old
    H₁ : A_new < A_old

(c) Se = σ / √n = 10 / √64 = 10 / 8 = 5 / 4

    it shows how far the sample mean is from the baseline

(d) z = (69 - 72) / (10/8) = (3 × 8) / 10 = 24 / 5

    z = (S_m - μ) / Se

(e) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with a peak at 72 and a vertical dashed line at 69. The area to the left of 69 is shaded, indicating the region of interest.

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(a) prior probability → P(s)
    P(s) = 0.2

(b) posterior probability ⇒ P(s/m)
    it is the probability that we are searching for which in this case is probability of spam given the message is spam.

(c) P(s/m) = (0.2 × 0.9) / [P(m/s)⋅P(s) + P(m/¬s)⋅P(¬s)]
    = (0.2 × 0.9) / [(0.9 × 0.2) + (0.05 × 0.8)]

    P(m) = P(m/s)⋅P(s) + P(m/¬s)⋅P(¬s)
    = 0.9 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8 ← Ans

(d) lower, since it is a conditional probability, we have a new world. Since world is smaller, posterior probability will also be lower
