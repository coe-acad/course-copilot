Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) population mean is 72 bpm
Sample mean is 69 bpm

(b) Null hypothesis (H₀): New relaxation app does not reduces the average heart resting rate.
Alternative hypothesis (H₁): New relaxation app will reduces the average resting heart rate.

(c) standard error = σ / √n = 72 / √64 = 72 / 8 = 9
Standard error means population mean divided by square root of sample size.

(d) z-score = (x̄ - μ) / σₑ = (69 - 72) / 9 = -3 / 9 = -1/3 ≈ -0.3

(e) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with peak at 72 and a vertical line at 69. The area to the left of 69 is shaded.

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(a) P(A) = 20% = 0.2    P(AC) = 100 - 20 = 80% = 0.8
    P(B/A) = 90% = 0.9
    P(B/AC) = 5% = 0.05

The prior probability in the above equation is P(A) = 0.2
The prior probability based on the example is P(A) = 0.2

(b) In the equation P(A|B) is the posterior probability.
In the above example the posterior probability is
Spam message is marked as spam by the gitter.

(c) P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|AC) P(AC) is the expression from the equation that gives total probability.

P(A|B) = 0.2 * 0.9 / (0.9)(0.2) + (0.05)(0.8)

(d) The posterior probability will become higher once we update the prior, so in the above equation it will be higher.

### PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES

**QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 92 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - High clarity, minor ambiguity in mathematical notation (e.g., σₑ vs SE)
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - Image description is comprehensive but lacks precise shading details
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some characters are slightly unclear (e.g., "reduces" appears twice in H₁)

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- Minor uncertainty in mathematical symbols (e.g., standard error notation)
- Image shading description could be more precise

---

**QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 88 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 36/40 - Some phrases are slightly unclear (e.g., "by the gitter" may be "filter")
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No images present
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present
- Handwriting Legibility: 7/15 - Several words are ambiguous or potentially misread

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- "gitter" may be a misreading of "filter" or similar term
- Some probability expressions lack clarity in notation
- Handwriting becomes less legible toward the end of the question

---

### TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 90 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 37/40 - High overall accuracy with minor uncertainties in mathematical and probabilistic notation
- Visual Elements: 24/25 - Excellent image description but one instance where shading details could be improved
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present in the document
- Handwriting Legibility: 9/15 - Handwriting clarity varies, particularly in longer answers and toward the end of the document

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Ambiguity in certain terms (e.g., "gitter" vs "filter")
- Mathematical notation inconsistencies (e.g., standard error symbol)
- Fading or unclear handwriting in some sections

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for mathematical content and image descriptions
- Some probabilistic terms may require verification due to handwriting ambiguity
- Confidence is lower for Question 2 due to unclear phrasing and handwriting degradation
