Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) Population mean = 72 And Sample mean = 69

(b) The hypothesis which is less than 5 is known as Null hypothesis. And the hypothesis which is greater than 5 is known as alternative hypothesis.

(c) 1.25

(d) 2.4

(e) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
TEXT IN IMAGE: None visible beyond the graph elements
IMAGE TYPE: line_graph
A normal distribution curve is drawn with a vertical dashed line near the right tail. The area to the left of a value around 69 is shaded, representing the region under the curve for the sample mean relative to the population mean.
IMAGE CONTEXT: This graph relates to question 1, showing the distribution of sample means and the position of the observed sample mean.]

### PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES

**QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 92 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - Most text is clear, though some words in part (b) are slightly ambiguous ("less than 5" and "greater than 5" appear to reference a threshold, but the exact value is unclear).
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - The graph is well-described, but the exact position of the vertical dashed line is approximate.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some words in part (b) are slightly unclear due to handwriting style.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- The phrase "less than 5" and "greater than 5" in part (b) is ambiguous; it may refer to a significance level or a test statistic threshold.
- The graph's exact numerical labels on the x-axis are not fully clear.

---

**QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 95 / 100**

BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 39/40 - All text is clear and accurately transcribed.
- Visual Elements: 25/25 - No images or diagrams present.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - The handwriting is clear, though some symbols (e.g., Aᶜ) are slightly ambiguous in style.

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- The complement symbol (Aᶜ) in part (d) is assumed based on context but could be misinterpreted due to handwriting.

---

### TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 93.5 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 38.5/40 - High accuracy overall, with minor ambiguities in handwriting interpretation.
- Visual Elements: 24/25 - The graph in Question 1 was well-described, but exact positioning of elements is approximate.
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables were present in the document.
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some phrases and symbols are slightly unclear due to handwriting style.

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Ambiguity in the phrasing of part (b) in Question 1 regarding the "5" threshold.
- Interpretation of handwritten symbols, particularly in probability notation.

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for most content, with minor uncertainties in specific phrases and symbols.
- The graph in Question 1 is accurately described but may require verification for exact numerical values.
