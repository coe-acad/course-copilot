Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) population mean = 100
    Sample mean = 64

(b) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with mean at 66, sample mean at 64, shaded area on the left with z-score calculation shown.
TEXT IN IMAGE: 66 - 64 = z, S.E. = 2/10 = 0.2, 64, 66
IMAGE TYPE: diagram
IMAGE CONTEXT: Question 1 part (b), showing z-score calculation and standard error]

# Standard error = σ / √n

(c) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with mean at 64, population mean at 66, shaded area on the right.
TEXT IN IMAGE: σ/√n, 64, 66, x
IMAGE TYPE: diagram
IMAGE CONTEXT: Question 1 part (c), showing relationship between sample and population means]

================================================================================

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(a) The prior probability here in the above equation is P(A), the Value of the priors probability based on the example is 20%.

(b) The posterior probability in the equation above is P(B|A), if a message is spam, the filter masks it as spam with 90% probability.

(c) P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / [P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)]

= (90/100)(20/100) / [(90/100)(20/100) + (5/100)(80/100)]

= (9/50) / [(9/50) + (4/50)]

= 9/13

**PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES**

QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 92 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - Clear handwriting, minor ambiguity in "Sample mean" vs "sample mean" capitalization
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - Diagrams are clear but some text in images is slightly faded
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables in this question
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some symbols and spacing are slightly unclear

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- The standard error formula uses "#" which may be a handwritten quirk for a bullet point
- Diagram labels are slightly faded but mostly legible

QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 88 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 36/40 - Some probability notation is slightly unclear (e.g., A^c vs A')
- Visual Elements: 22/25 - No images but calculation layout is clear
- Table Structure: 18/20 - Small calculation steps are tabular but not a formal table
- Handwriting Legibility: 12/15 - Some fractions and probability symbols are cramped

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- The notation "A^c" vs "A'" is ambiguous in handwriting
- The calculation steps are slightly crowded but readable
- The final answer "9/13" is clear but the path to it has some unclear fractions

---

**TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 90 / 100**

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 37/40 - High accuracy with minor ambiguities in mathematical notation
- Visual Elements: 22.5/25 - Diagrams are well-described but some text within images is faded
- Table Structure: 19/20 - Calculation steps are accurately captured
- Handwriting Legibility: 11.5/15 - Generally clear but some symbols and spacing are challenging

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Faded text in diagrams reduces confidence for visual elements
- Ambiguous probability notation (A^c vs A') in Question 2
- Cramped fractions and calculations in probability work

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- The extraction is highly reliable for the main content
- Mathematical notation should be verified for A^c vs A' interpretation
- Diagram text is mostly clear but may need slight review for 100% accuracy
