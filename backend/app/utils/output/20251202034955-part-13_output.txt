Q1.
   a) population mean = 100
   b) Sample mean = 64

   c)
   [IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
   TEXT IN IMAGE:
   - 66 - 64 = 2
   - S.E: 2/10 = 0.2
   - Standard error = σ/√n

   IMAGE TYPE: sketch

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
Q2.
   a) The prior probability here in the above equation is P(A), the value of the prior probability based on the example is 20%.

   b) The posterior probability in the equation above is P(B|A). If a message is spam, the filter marks it as spam with 90% probability.

   c)
   P(A|B) = (P(B|A) P(A)) / (P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c))

   [UNCERTAIN: P(B|A) = 90%], P(A) = 20%
   P(B|A^c) = 5%, P(A^c) = 80%

   = (9/10)(20/100) / [(9/10)(20/100) + (5/100)(80/100)]
   = (9/50) / [(9/50) + (4/50)]
   = (9/50) / (13/50)
   = 9/13

   d) The posterior probability will be higher.
