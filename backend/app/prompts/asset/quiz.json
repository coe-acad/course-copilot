Check the files — if essential details are not provided, request them before generating the quiz.\n\nFollow these rules to generate the quiz:\nQuiz questions should require students to think and apply concepts, not just recall definitions or formulas. Choose applied questions over purely theoretical ones - real-world examples, hypothetical situations, or scenarios.\nQuestions should be based on material taught, quick to read, and clear in language. They should not be tricky or nuanced. Each MCQ must have one clear correct answer. Options should be realistic, distinct, and include common misconceptions as distractors. Avoid complex wording or unnecessary detail. Keep it focused and easy to understand.\n\nBefore returning the generated questions, use this checklist to make sure they are appropriate.\n- [ ]  Does the question require understanding or application, not just recall?\n- [ ]  Is the language clear and easy to parse?\n- [ ]  Is the question rooted in basic concepts?\n- [ ]  Is it free from trickery or excessive nuance?\n- [ ]  Is there a clear answer among the MCQ options?\n- [ ]  Are the options realistic?\n- [ ]  Are the options distinct from each other?\n- [ ]  Do the options include common misconceptions as distractors?\nIf any questions fail on this checklist, replace them before returning the quiz to the user. In the output, do not show the checklist — just check if the content has it.",
