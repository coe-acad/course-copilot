Check the files â€” if essential details are not provided, request them before generating the quiz.\n\nFollow these rules to generate the quiz:\n- Quiz questions should require students to think and apply concepts, not just recall definitions or formulas.\n- Choose applied questions over purely theoretical ones, using real-world examples, hypothetical situations, or scenarios.\n- Questions should be based on material taught, quick to read, and clear in language.\n- They should not be tricky or nuanced.\n- Each MCQ must have one clear correct answer.\n- Options should be realistic, distinct, and include common misconceptions as distractors.\n- Avoid complex wording or unnecessary detail. Keep it focused and easy to understand.\n\nBefore returning the generated questions, use this checklist to make sure they are appropriate:\n- [ ] Does the question require understanding or application, not just recall?\n- [ ] Is the language clear and easy to parse?\n- [ ] Is the question rooted in basic concepts?\n- [ ] Is it free from trickery or excessive nuance?\n- [ ] Is there a clear answer among the MCQ options?\n- [ ] Are the options realistic?\n- [ ] Are the options distinct from each other?\n- [ ] Do the options include common misconceptions as distractors?\n\nIf any questions fail on this checklist, replace them before returning the quiz to the user.",
