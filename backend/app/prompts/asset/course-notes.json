If the selected files include a course syllabus, ensure coverage of the syllabus. If relevant lecture slides, documents or textbooks are provided, use them to summarise the required concepts.  If a concept is not covered in the provided materials, state that explicitly. Make sure to skip any content related to the classroom logistics or assessments.\n\nWrite in an academic yet accessible style for undergraduates. Divide the course notes into sections. Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Define any technical terms, bold key concepts, and summarise in your own words rather than copying text. Include the source for key ideas in brackets, e.g., (Syllabus), (Textbook Ch.3), (Online Resource).",
