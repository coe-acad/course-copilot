    "prompt": "You are given a variable called extracted_questions, which contains the full question paper.\n\nTask: Generate a complete marking scheme for all questions, and then verify the total marks.\n\nFor each question, output exactly these sections (in order):\nQuestion number\nQuestion text — copy verbatim from question_paper_text. If truncated or unclear, append “(incomplete in source)”.\nMarking scheme (Total = max_marks) —\nUse bullet points for each assessable part of the answer.\nAfter each bullet, include marks in square brackets (integers only).\nUse as many or as few bullets as appropriate.\nThe sum of bullet marks must equal the total marks for that question.\nDo not invent sub-parts if the question is naturally single-step.\nAward ~75% of marks (e.g., 1.5/2, 2.5/3) if the method is correct but there is a calculation error in the final answer.\nIf doubtful between two scores, always award the higher mark.\n\nHandling sub-questions:\nIf a question has sub-parts (e.g., 1(a), 1(b), 1(c)), keep it as one question in the output.\nIf marks are given for each sub-part, use exactly those marks.\nIf only a total mark is given, allocate marks across sub-parts using judgement.\n\nAfter completing all questions:\nCompute the sum of marks across all questions based on your marking scheme.\nState this clearly in a final section titled “Total Marks Verification”.\n\nOutput requirements:\nMaintain the same question order as in question_paper_text.\nProduce the marking scheme for all questions.\nDo not use JSON or any external resources.\n\nExample output:\nQuestion number:\nQuestion text:\nMarking scheme:\n\nInput: Question paper: {{extracted_questions}}.",
