    "prompt":"You are given a variable called question_paper_text. This variable refers to the full question paper. Do NOT echo or restate it.\n\nFor each question, assign marks as given in the question paper, either given in brackets or against each question. Generate a numbered Scheme of Evaluation in the following format for ALL the questions in question_paper_text:\n\nFor each question, output exactly these four sections:\n- Question number\n- Question — copy each question verbatim from question_paper_text. If truncated or illegible, append \"(incomplete in source)\" at the end.\n- Answer template — bullet the minimum core ideas (or clear equivalents) in strict logical order needed for full credit. Use short, precise bullets. If a single correct answer is unambiguous (value/option/etc.), state it explicitly.\n- Marking scheme (Total = max_marks) — one bullet per core idea, labeled A, B, C in the same order as the Answer template. After each label, put the marks in parentheses, e.g. A (2), then a terse description of the expectation in context. Strictly limit the number of bullets to three.\n\nThe marks on A+B+C must sum exactly to max_marks printed in the paper. Ensure there are no errors in this. Recheck the marking scheme if required.\n\nInteger-only per-bullet marks: The number inside each parenthesis ( ) must be an integer (digits only)—no decimals/fractions (e.g., no (0.5), (1.0), ½). If finer granularity seems needed, restructure by confining to the most essential bullets in the answer.\n\nMini-example (for a 5-mark item):\nMarking scheme (Total = 5)\nA (2): states/defines core principle in this context\nB (2): applies principle correctly to the given setup\nC (1): computes/states final result with correct units/justification\n\nWhen a question contains sub-parts (e.g., 1(a), 1(b), 1(c)), keep the entire question together as one question in the output. However, in the marking scheme, you must create separate marking scheme entries for each sub-question. If the question paper shows marks for each sub-question, use exactly those marks in the marking scheme for 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), etc. If the question has sub-parts but only one total mark is given for the entire question and there are no marks shown for individual sub-questions, then still show separate marking-scheme lines for each sub-question, but divide the total marks equally across them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your output must be in STRUCTURED TEXT format using the exact format below for each question. Do NOT use JSON or any brackets.\n\nFormat for each question:\nquestionnumber: 1\nquestion: Copy the question text exactly here\nanswertemplate: Bullet points of core ideas\nmarkingscheme:\n    A (marks): description\n    B (marks): description\n    C (marks): description\n\nExample output:\nquestionnumber: 1\nquestion: What is the capital of France?\nanswertemplate: The capital of France is Paris\nmarkingscheme:\n    A (5): Correctly identifies Paris as the capital\n\nquestionnumber: 2\nquestion: Explain the process of photosynthesis\nanswertemplate: Light energy converts CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen through chloroplasts\nmarkingscheme:\n    A (3): Mentions light energy and chloroplasts\n    B (3): Correctly states reactants (CO2 and water)\n    C (2): Correctly states products (glucose and oxygen)\n\nNow generate the mark scheme in this STRUCTURED TEXT format for all questions in question_paper_text. Each question must have all the fields listed above: questionnumber, question, answertemplate, and markingscheme.\n\nMake sure you use only the file question_paper_text and give the response for all the questions in the question paper. Maintain the same question order as in question_paper_text. If a question has sub-parts, keep a single entry for the whole question; do not split into '2(a)', '2(b)'. Handle marks via bullets as per Sub-question handling.\n\nBefore giving the final output, please check once again whether your generated content contains the mark scheme for ALL the questions. If it does not, please regenerate the mark scheme afresh based on the instructions in this prompt.\n\nRequired_input_variables\nQuestion paper: {{extracted_questions}}",
