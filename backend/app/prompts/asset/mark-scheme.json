    "prompt": "You are given a variable called `question_paper_text`.\n\nThis variable refers to the full question paper.\n\nFor each question, assign marks as given in the question paper, either given in brackets or against each question. Generate a numbered Scheme of Evaluation in the following format for ALL the questions in question_paper_text. :\n\nFor each question, output exactly these four sections:\nQuestion number\nQuestion text — copy each question verbatim from question_paper_text. If truncated or illegible, append “(incomplete in source)” at the end.\nAnswer template — bullet the minimum core ideas (or clear equivalents) in strict logical order needed for full credit. Use short, precise bullets. If a single correct answer is unambiguous (value/option/etc.), state it explicitly.\nMarking scheme (Total = max_marks) — one bullet per core idea, labeled A, B, C in the same order as the Answer template. After each label, put the marks in square brackets, e.g. A [2], then a terse description of the expectation in context. Strictly limit the number of bullets to three (in case of questions where there are no sub-questions).\n\nThe marks on A+B+C must sum exactly to max_marks printed in the paper. Ensure there are no errors in this. Recheck the marking scheme if required.\n\nInteger-only per-bullet marks: The number inside each square bracket [ ] must be an integer (digits only)—no decimals/fractions (e.g., no [0.5], [1.0], ½). If finer granularity seems needed, restructure by confining to the most essential bullets in the answer.\nMini-example (for a 5-mark item)\nMarking scheme (Total = 5)\n A [2]: states/defines core principle in this context\n B [2]: applies principle correctly to the given setup\n C [1]: computes/states final result with correct units/justification\nHandling questions with sub-parts:\nWhen a question contains sub-parts (e.g., 1(a), 1(b), 1(c)), keep the entire question together as one question in the output. If only one total mark is given for the entire question, you must create separate mark allocation in the mark scheme area for each sub-question. You should use your judgement while allocation marks to the subquestions.\n\nIf the question paper shows marks for each sub-question, use exactly those marks in the marking scheme for 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), etc.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your output must be in STRUCTURED TEXT format using the exact format below for each question. Do NOT use JSON or any brackets.\n\nFormat for each question\nquestionnumber: 1\nquestion: Copy the question text exactly here\nanswertemplate: Bullet points of core ideas\nmarkingscheme:\nA (marks): description\nB (marks): description   \nC (marks): description\n\nNow generate the mark scheme in this STRUCTURED TEXT format for all questions in question_paper_text. Each question must have all the fields listed above: questionnumber, question, answertemplate, and markingscheme.\n\nMake sure you use only the file question_paper_text and give the response for all the questions in the question paper. Maintain the same question order as in question_paper_text. If a question has sub-parts, keep a single entry for the whole question; do not split into '2(a)', '2(b)'. Handle marks via bullets as per Sub-question handling.\n\nBefore giving the final output, please check once again whether your generated content contains the mark scheme for ALL the questions. If it does not, please regenerate the mark scheme afresh based on the instructions in this prompt.\n\nAlso, please sum up marks of all the questions from the mark scheme you prepared, and compulsorily confirm with the user through a clarifying question whether the total marks you have on the mark scheme matches with what the user expected. Only once the user confirms, please go ahead and generate the mark scheme.\n\nRequired_input_variables\nQuestion paper: {{extracted_questions}}(Do not use any other resource)",
