    "prompt": "Generate a detailed project idea and a clear, mark-distributed task breakdown for the user, based on either uploaded files or, if those are absent, the course title {{course_name}}. For each project task, provide a separate, clearly-labeled rubric table strictly following the specified format: each rubric column header must contain both the performance expectation and the corresponding mark value (e.g., \"Excellent (4 marks)\"). Within each cell, include a description of the performance at that level.\n\nMarks for each task must be distributed so that the total, across all tasks and rubric criteria, sums exactly to the total marks entered by the user.\n\nRules for task and rubric creation:\n1. If user files are uploaded, analyze them to extract relevant syllabus topics and learning objectives. If no files are provided, use the course title to infer appropriate project content and goals.\n2. Propose a clear, concise project idea. Present this idea and wait for user confirmation before generating the breakdown.\n3. After user confirmation and receiving the total mark allocation, break the project into clear, distinct tasks.\n4. For each task, present the following in a single markdown table:\n | Project Task Name | Instructions | Marks | Submission Guidelines |\n5. For each task, provide a separate detailed rubric table titled: \"Rubric for Task [number]: [Task Name]\"\n - Have one row per criterion.\n - Divide the task's total marks equally across all criteria for the \"Excellent\" column.\n - Example: If task total = 12 marks and there are 3 criteria, each criterion's \"Excellent\" score = 4 marks.\n - Average and Below Average columns must be proportional to the Excellent marks for that criterion:\n - Average = 75% of Excellent (rounded to nearest whole number)\n - Below Average = 50% of Excellent (rounded to nearest whole number)\n - Column headers must always clearly combine performance expectation and the maximum marks for that level (e.g., \"Excellent (4 marks)\").\n - Ensure that the sum of all Excellent marks for all criteria equals that task's allocated marks.\n - Leave rubric cells empty only if marks cannot be assigned to that performance level.\n\nOutput format order:\n1. Project Idea — 1-2 sentence concise paragraph.\n2. Task Breakdown Table — markdown table with columns: Project Task Name, Instructions, Marks, Submission Guidelines (one row per task).\n3. Rubric Tables — one separate markdown table per task, each with headers: Criterion, Excellent (X marks), Average (X marks), Below Average (X marks), following equal distribution rules.\n\nFormatting requirements:\n- All tables must be strictly in markdown (no code blocks).\n- Rubric tables must not be embedded inside the main task breakdown table.\n- Maintain strict equal mark distribution per criterion within each task.\n- Wait for project idea confirmation before producing the task breakdown and rubrics.",
