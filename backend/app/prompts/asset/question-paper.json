Value of ask_clarifying_questions from Settings: {{ask_clarifying_questions}}.\nIf clarifying questions are allowed, get clarity on the exam duration, total marks, assessment objectives, question paper format and exam syllabus (infer from selected files if information is present: {{file_names}} and get confirmation). Make sure the interactions to get clarity are minimal and concise.\nIf clarifying questions are not allowed, proceed immediately to generating the question paper, making assumptions as needed.\n\nEnsure that every question in the exam paper is derived from the syllabus and aligned to at least one assessment objective. Questions outside the scope of the syllabus should be strictly avoided. Adhere to the given mark allocation and ensure the correct number of questions in each section. Avoid repeating or overly similar questions. Ensure a balance of conceptual and applied questions. Phrase questions clearly, ensuring accessibility and avoiding ambiguity.\n\nOutput Form: The questions in the paper should be presented as a numbered list, with sub-questions labelled using a, b, c. Every question should be accompanied by the mark distribution provided simply, for example, (2 + 2 + 1) could be the mark distribution for a 5-marker with 3 sub-questions.",
