  "prompt": "Evaluate the extracted answers against the mark scheme.\n\nCRITICAL: Preserve the EXACT question_text from the mark scheme and student_answer from the extracted answers without modification, truncation, or summarization.\n\nEach answer sheet contains:\n- Question_number: The question identifier\n- Student_answer: FULL COMPLETE student response (preserve exactly as provided)\n\nEach item in the mark scheme data has:\nQuestion_number\nQuestion_text\nAnswer_template\nMarking_scheme\n\nCompare the student's answer in {{answer_sheets}} to the answer_template and marking_scheme.\n\nGrade on correctness, completeness, and reasoning—not verbatim match to the mark scheme.\nReduce only 0.5 marks from the maximum possible, if the method is correct, but there is a calculation error in the final answer.\nAward full marks for complete answers even if brief. Award proportional partial credit based on the specific milestones in the marking_scheme. Award zero marks for attempts that contain no correct points.\nIf doubtful between two scores, always award the higher mark.\nReturn a numeric score and one-sentence justification (what’s correct + why any deductions).\n\nIMAGE HANDLING: Student answers may be images (diagrams, drawings, calculations, graphs, flowcharts, etc.). When you see {\"type\":\"image\",\"file_id\":\"file-abc123\"} in the answer without any accompanying text, treat it as a complete answer—not supplementary material. Thoroughly inspect the image, evaluate it against the marking criteria, and award marks based on what the image shows. For image-only answers, credit correct concepts, accurate/appropriate diagrams, clear labeling, and sound calculations or graph features, and give full marks if the image alone demonstrates correct understanding. Do not deduct marks for missing text when the image suffices. If an image is illegible or cannot be opened, state “image unreadable”.\n\nMIXED ANSWERS (IMAGE + TEXT): When you see {\"type\":\"image\",\"file_id\":\"file-abc123\"}, treat it as an image. In cases where the answer has both image and text, treat them as a single combined response—award credit for any correct, clearly evidenced work in either medium; if they conflict, credit the element (image or text) that demonstrates the correct method/result and briefly note the contradiction. If an image is illegible or cannot be opened, grade the text alone and state “image unreadable”; always preserve the exact student_answer including the raw image JSON objects.\n\nRequired Output:\nReturn a JSON array of objects with keys:\n\nQuestion_text\nQuestion_number\nStudent_answer\nScore\nFeedback (One-sentence justification)\nmax_score\n(note make sure you give the max_score all the times for all the papers)\n\nEvaluation Data:\nEvaluation ID: {{evaluation_id}}\nMark scheme data: {{mark_scheme}}\nStudents answer sheet data: {{answer_sheets}}",
