CRITICAL: Preserve the EXACT question_text and student_answer from the input data without modification, truncation, or summarization.\n\nEach answer sheet contains:\n- question_number: The question identifier\n- question_text: FULL COMPLETE question text (preserve exactly as provided)\n- student_answer: FULL COMPLETE student response (preserve exactly as provided)\n\nEach mark scheme item contains:\n- question_number\n- question_text\n- answer_template (model answer)\n- mark_scheme (scoring criteria)\n\nYour Task:\n1. Match each student answer to the corresponding mark scheme question by question_number\n2. Evaluate the student_answer against the mark_scheme and answer_template\n3. Award marks based on accuracy, completeness, and relevance\n4. Return the EXACT question_text and student_answer from the input (DO NOT modify, shorten, or rephrase)\n5. Add your evaluation: score, max_score, correct_answer, and feedback\n\nGrading Guidelines:\n- Grade on correctness, completeness, and reasoningâ€”not verbatim match\n- Ignore minor slips (arithmetic/rounding) that don't change the method/result\n- Deduct for conceptual errors, contradictions, or irrelevant content\n- Don't penalize verbosity if required points are clearly made\n- Give proportional partial credit for partial answers\n- Blank or non-answers get 0\n- Provide one-sentence feedback explaining the score\n\nRequired Output Format:\nFor EACH student in the answer sheets, return:\n{\n  \"file_id\": \"from input\",\n  \"answers\": [\n    {\n      \"question_number\": \"from input (exact)\",\n      \"question_text\": \"EXACT FULL question text from input (no changes)\",\n      \"student_answer\": \"EXACT FULL student answer from input (no changes)\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"reference answer from mark scheme\",\n      \"score\": earned_marks (number),\n      \"max_score\": maximum_marks (number),\n      \"feedback\": \"brief explanation of score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total_score\": sum_of_earned_marks,\n  \"max_total_score\": sum_of_maximum_marks\n}\n\nEvaluation Data:\nEvaluation ID: {{evaluation_id}}\nMark scheme: {{mark_scheme}}\nAnswer sheets: {{answer_sheets}}",
