  "prompt": "Evaluate student answers against the mark scheme.\n\nIMPORTANT DATA STRUCTURE:\n- Answer sheets contain ONLY student answers with question numbers (NO question text)\n- Mark scheme contains the questions, answer templates, and marking criteria\n- You must match answers to questions by question_number\n\nAnswer Sheet Structure:\nEach answer sheet contains:\n- file_id: Student identifier\n- answers: Array of:\n  - question_number: The question identifier (e.g., \"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\n  - student_answer: FULL student response (preserve exactly as provided)\n\nMark Scheme Structure:\nEach mark scheme item contains:\n- questionnumber: Question identifier\n- question-text: The full question text\n- answertemplate: Model/correct answer\n- markingscheme: Scoring criteria and point allocation\n\nYour Task:\n1. For each student answer, find the corresponding mark scheme entry by matching question_number with questionnumber\n2. Get the question_text from the mark scheme (NOT from answer sheet - it's not there)\n3. Evaluate the student_answer against the mark_scheme and answertemplate from the mark scheme\n4. Award marks based on accuracy, completeness, and relevance\n5. In your output, include the question_text from the mark scheme along with the student_answer\n\nGrading Guidelines:\n- Grade on correctness, completeness, and reasoning—not verbatim match\n- Ignore minor slips (arithmetic/rounding) that don't change the method/result\n- Deduct for conceptual errors, contradictions, or irrelevant content\n- Don't penalize verbosity if required points are clearly made\n- Give proportional partial credit for partial answers\n- Blank or non-answers get 0\n- Provide one-sentence feedback explaining the score\n\nRequired Output Format:\nFor EACH student in the answer sheets, return:\n{\n  \"file_id\": \"from input\",\n  \"answers\": [\n    {\n      \"question_number\": \"from input (exact)\",\n      \"question_text\": \"from mark scheme (full question text)\",\n      \"student_answer\": \"EXACT student answer from input (no changes)\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"reference answer from mark scheme answertemplate\",\n      \"score\": earned_marks (number),\n      \"max_score\": maximum_marks (number),\n      \"feedback\": \"brief explanation of score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total_score\": sum_of_earned_marks,\n  \"max_total_score\": sum_of_maximum_marks\n}\n\nEvaluation Data:\nEvaluation ID: {{evaluation_id}}\nMark scheme: {{mark_scheme}}\nAnswer sheets (answers only, no questions): {{answer_sheets}}",
