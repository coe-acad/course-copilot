Question 1:
----------------------------------------
(a) population mean : 64
    sample mean : 69

(b) null = new app does not reduce resting heart rates
    Alternative : new app reduces resting heart rates

    H₀ : A_new > A_old
    H₁ : A_new < A_old

(c) Se = σ / √n = 10 / √64 = 10 / 8 = 5 / 4

    it shows how far the sample mean is from the baseline

(d) z = (69 - 72) / (10/8) = (3 × 8) / 10 = 24 / 5

    z = (S_m - μ) / Se

(e) [IMAGE DESCRIPTION: Normal distribution curve with a peak at 72 and a vertical dashed line at 69. The area to the left of 69 is shaded. The values 69 and 72 are labeled on the x-axis.

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
(a) prior probability → P(s)
    P(s) = 0.2

(b) posterior probability ⇒ P(s/m)
    it is the probability that we are searching for which in this case is probability of spam given the message is spam.

(c) P(s/m) = (0.2 × 0.9) / [P(m/s)⋅P(s) + P(m/¬s)⋅P(¬s)]
    = (0.2 × 0.9) / [(0.9 × 0.2) + (0.05 × 0.8)]

    P(m) = P(m/s)⋅P(s) + P(m/¬s)⋅P(¬s)
    = 0.9 × 0.2 + 0.05 × 0.8 ← Ans

(d) lower, since it is a conditional probability, we have a new world. Since world is smaller, posterior probability will also be lower

### PER-QUESTION CONFIDENCE SCORES

QUESTION 1 CONFIDENCE: 95 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 1:
- Text Accuracy: 39/40 - High clarity, minor uncertainty in fraction formatting in part (d)
- Visual Elements: 24/25 - Image description is comprehensive and accurate
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present
- Handwriting Legibility: 12/15 - Some minor ambiguity in mathematical notation

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 1:
- Slight uncertainty in fraction formatting in part (d) (24/5 vs 24 ÷ 5)
- Handwriting for mathematical symbols is clear but some spacing issues

QUESTION 2 CONFIDENCE: 92 / 100
BREAKDOWN FOR QUESTION 2:
- Text Accuracy: 38/40 - High accuracy, minor uncertainty in probability notation
- Visual Elements: 23/25 - No images, but probability notation is complex
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present
- Handwriting Legibility: 11/15 - Some probability symbols are slightly unclear

ISSUES FOR QUESTION 2:
- Probability notation (P(s/m), P(m/s)) is occasionally ambiguous
- The word "posterior" in part (b) is slightly unclear but contextually clear
- Some fraction formatting could be interpreted differently

### TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE

TOTAL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 93.5 / 100

OVERALL BREAKDOWN:
- Text Accuracy: 38.5/40 - High character recognition accuracy with minor formatting uncertainties
- Visual Elements: 23.5/25 - Excellent image description, no visual elements in Q2
- Table Structure: 20/20 - No tables present in either question
- Handwriting Legibility: 11.5/15 - Generally clear handwriting with occasional symbol ambiguity

KEY CHALLENGES:
- Mathematical notation interpretation, particularly fractions and probability symbols
- Some spacing and alignment issues in handwritten equations
- Minor uncertainty in conditional probability notation

RELIABILITY NOTES:
- Extraction is highly reliable for both questions
- Mathematical content should be verified for fraction formatting
- Probability notation in Question 2 is contextually clear but has minor legibility issues
- Image description in Question 1(e) accurately represents the visual content
