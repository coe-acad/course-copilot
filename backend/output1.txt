Question 1:
----------------------------------------
a) population mean = 72 bpm
   sample mean = 69 bpm

   b) H₀ -> μ ≤ 69 bpm
      H₁ -> μ > 69 bpm

   c) Distance in terms of standard errors
      S.E = σ/√n = 10/√64 = 10/8 = 1.25

   d) Z - Score = (72 - 69) / 1.25 = 3 / 1.25 = 2.4

   e)
   [IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
   TEXT IN IMAGE:
   - A normal distribution curve with a shaded area to the right.
   - The mean (μ) is marked as 69.
   - The point 72 is marked with a Z-score of 2.4.
   - The shaded area represents the probability beyond 72 bpm.

Question 2:
----------------------------------------
a) P(S) = 20% = 0.2
      probability of all incoming messages are spam (PCA) (prior).

   b) P(A|B) is the posterior, posterior is the updated probability after getting evidence.

   c) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
      (0.9)(0.1) + (0.05)(0.95) = 0.13

   d) The posterior probability will be high, because it is the updated probability after getting evidence, it will be finalized.
