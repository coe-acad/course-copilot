# Testing Guide - LMS Export Frontend Flow

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### Frontend
1. **Fixed Header Component** - Changed from `AppHeader` to `DashboardHeader` which has the "Export to LMS" button
2. **Added LMSLoginModal** - New login modal component
3. **Updated Flow** - Click Export ‚Üí Login Modal ‚Üí Export Modal

### Backend
1. **Added Mock Mode** - Backend now returns a mock response when `LMS_BASE_URL` is not configured
2. **No Configuration Needed** - You can test the frontend flow without setting up LMS connection

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
# Activate virtual environment if needed
# source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)
# venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test the Flow

1. **Login to your application** (with your regular course-copilot credentials)

2. **Navigate to the Dashboard page**

3. **Look for the "Export to LMS" button** in the header (blue button with upload icon)
   
4. **Click "Export to LMS"**
   - ‚úÖ The LMS Login Modal should appear
   - ‚úÖ You should see a yellow warning box saying "DEVELOPMENT MODE"

5. **Enter any email and password**
   - Can use test@example.com / password123
   - Or any other credentials (they won't be validated in mock mode)

6. **Click "Login to LMS"**
   - ‚úÖ Should show loading spinner
   - ‚úÖ Should close the login modal
   - ‚úÖ Should automatically open the Export Assets Modal
   - ‚úÖ Check browser console - should show "Running in MOCK MODE"

7. **Check localStorage**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage
   - ‚úÖ Should see `lms_token` with value like "mock_lms_token_for_testing_..."
   - ‚úÖ Should see `lms_user` with mock user data

8. **In Export Assets Modal**
   - Select some assets
   - Click Export
   - ‚úÖ Should download a JSON file with formatted assets

                                      Blue button
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Export to LMS" button not visible

- **Check:** Is the DashboardHeader component loading?
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors

### Modal doesn't open when clicking Export
- **Check:** Browser console for errors
- **Check:** React DevTools for state changes
- **Solution:** Refresh the page and try again

### "Authorization failed" or 401 error
- **Check:** Are you logged into the course-copilot app?
- **Check:** Is there a valid token in localStorage?
- **Solution:** Logout and login again

### Backend errors
- **Check:** Is backend running on port 8000?
- **Check:** Backend console for error messages
- **Solution:** Restart backend server

### Frontend won't compile
- **Check:** Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies
- **Check:** Look for missing imports
- **Solution:** Check console for specific error

```

## üîÑ Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the frontend flow works:

1. **When you get LMS_BASE_URL:**
   - Add `LMS_BASE_URL=https://your-lms-platform.com` to backend `.env`
   - Restart backend
   - Backend will switch from mock mode to real LMS authentication

2. **Update the info message:**
   - Remove the yellow warning in `LMSLoginModal.js`
   - Replace with blue info box about secure transmission

3. **Test with real LMS:**
   - Use actual LMS credentials
   - Verify connection to real LMS platform
   - Check that real token is returned

## üí° Tips

- **Keep browser DevTools open** to see console messages and network requests
- **Check Network tab** to see API calls to `/api/login-lms`
- **Use React DevTools** to inspect component state
- **Check localStorage** to verify tokens are stored correctly
